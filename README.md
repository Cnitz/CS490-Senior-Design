A project management web application for group projects and teams.

One of the biggest challenges facing project teams is quickly and easily organizing team meetings and delegating tasks. Simplifying scheduling and other administrative tasks will allow a team’s members focus fully on the work needed to be done. While applications targeted towards small teams already exist, an emphasis on organizing meetings is lacking in current offerings. This web application will provide a simple interface for the handling of team’s administrative needs, focusing on the scheduling of group meetings.
